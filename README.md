# ios-anti-revoke
Hosts file optimized for Pi-Hole and network managers to block iOS revokes and optional updates

Just simply import it in, that's it.

There's no warranty to this or anything really. Just don't be an idiot I suppose.

# Instructions
Import one of two into Pi-Hole or a DNS blocker of your choice: \n
Raw: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databasethedev/ios-anti-revoke/master/hosts
Raw w/ Update Blocker: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databasethedev/ios-anti-revoke/master/hosts-block-updates

Refresh your DNS servers and that's pretty much it.
